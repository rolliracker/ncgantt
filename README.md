# ncGantt

A Nextcloud app that views and updates Deck boards in a Gantt chart.

It can also be used outside of Nextcloud: Just download everything and open index.html. You need a Nextcloud App Password to be able to connect to your Deck boards (in Nexcloud go to Settings -> Security -> scroll down to Add App Password)
